I'm Siddhartha Namburu, a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in robotics and control. I am curious and passionate about computer vision, machine learning, and their applications in robotics. My aim during my Master's is to concentrate my courses and research on the combination of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

I am currently working on leveraging the use of synthetic data in recognising actions recorded from an aerial camera. My ongoing research in computer vision, especially domain adaptation is being supervised by Professor [Fernando De la Torre Frade](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/index.html) and Professor [Jessica K. Hodgins](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkh/).

Prior to my master's at CMU, I worked as a machine learning engineer at DeepEdge where I integrated computer vision models on edge devices. I used Python (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffee, MxNet, onnx, TensorRT), C++(with cuda kernels and thrust library), Docker, to integrate face recognition, object detection, and pose estimation solutions on edge devices based on Ambarella(CV25) and Jetson-Nano. 

My interest in this field in my undergrad where I used evolutionary neural networks to predict the demand for fashion apparel. I also worked as a full-time intern at Nomura where I collaborated with the FinTech team in implementing ML, NLP technologies to automate use-cases in the finance division. Through this exercise, I gained an understanding of basic ML algorithms, specifically when I used and tested clustering algorithms like HBOS, DBSCAN.

Research Interest
------
I am interested in developing cross-disciplinary deep learning solutions, in particular Computer Vision (CV), Robotics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). During my Master's at CMU, I aim to fully use the resources to explore and work on applications in Computer Vision domain and further work on systems that belong to the intersection of machine learning and computer vision.  

Other Interests
-----
* Passionate about gaming and computer graphics.
* Love creating some notes in my piano.

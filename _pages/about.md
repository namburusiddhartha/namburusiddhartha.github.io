I am Siddhartha Namburu, a graduate student at CMU. I am curious and passionate about Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and their applications in robotics. I am currently working at Human Sensing Lab, Robotics Institute (CMU), on leveraging the use of synthetic data for training to recognize actions in real domain. My aim during my Master's is to concentrate my courses and research on combining Computer Vision and Machine Learning. During the summer, I interned at SRI International and worked on Whole body ID recognition using 3D human meshes from videos.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer at DeepEdge where I integrated computer vision models on edge devices. I used Python (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffee, TensorRT), C++(with Cuda kernels and thrust library), and Docker, to integrate face recognition, object detection, and key-point estimation solutions on Ambarella(CV25) chip. 

My aim is to concentrate my projects and research on learning-based methods in vision. I wish to use my experience and apply my skills in Computer Vision and Robotics. Towards this goal, I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Computer Vision and Machine Learning starting from December 2022.


Research Interest
------
I am interested in developing cross-disciplinary deep learning solutions, in particular Computer Vision (CV), Robotics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). During my Master's at CMU, I aim to fully use the resources to explore and work on applications in Computer Vision domain and further work on systems that belong to the intersection of machine learning and computer vision.  

Other Interests
-----
* Passionate about gaming and computer graphics.
* Love playing music on my piano.

I am Siddhartha Namburu, a graduate student at CMU. I am curious and passionate about Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and their applications in robotics. I am currently working at Human Sensing Lab, Robotics Institute (CMU), on leveraging the use of synthetic data for training to recognize actions in real domain. 

During my master's, I concentrated my courses on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I did projects on 3D percpetion:- 
1) Improving cost volume constructed in MVS NeRF
2) Depth and Velocity prediction using Monocular Images. 

During the summer, I interned at SRI International and worked on Whole body ID recognition using 3D human meshes from videos.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer at DeepEdge where I integrated computer vision models on edge devices. I used Python (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffee, TensorRT), C++(with Cuda kernels and thrust library), and Docker, to integrate face recognition, object detection, and key-point estimation solutions on Edge devices like Ambarella CV25 chip. 

Given my experience and skills, I am aspiring to establish a career in industry leveraging percpetion to solve problems. Towards this goal, I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.


Research Interest
------
I am interested in developing cross-disciplinary deep learning solutions, in particular Computer Vision (CV) and Robotics. I am interested in inferring physically and spatially grounded representations from perceptual input, and leveraging these for advances in fundamental problems in perception. 

Other Interests
-----
* Passionate about gaming and computer graphics.
* Love playing music on my piano.

This paper presents n algorithm  to reduce the number of Epicyclic gear trains of one degree of freedom (DOF) and with up to seven links. All possible Epi cyclic gear trains (EGT) of one DOF with a given number of links are generated from a set of EGTs of lower number of links. From the generated EGTs, structural isomorphic and rotational isomorphic ones are eliminated by assigning levels to turning pairs. An algorithm is proposed in this work, to reduce the number of EGTs to be handled to check for rotational isomorphism. The final number of unique EGTs are validated.

Research Assistant in the Mechanical Engineering Department supervised by Prof.[G.K. Anatha Suresh](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/suresh/) at IISc, Bangalore. My research was in collaboration with the Energy systems lab at IISc, Bangalore - India.

Research Overview
======

The Bio-Mechanical and Medical devices lab led by Prof.[G.K. Anatha Suresh](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/suresh/) mainly focusses on design and prototyping biomedical devices. The work in biomechanics by Prof. G.K. Ananthasuresh started with bio-micromanipulation of single cells for characterizing their mechanical response.  

The project we worked on involves optimising the design heat transfer device with hot and cold channels. This includes optimising number of channels, the shape of interface and other thermodynamic parameters.

My Contribution
======

* Developed a Thermal Resistance Network to simulate the heat flow and find temperatures in the the heat transfer design for different interface shapes.
* Devised a structural optimization algorithm to optimize the shape of interface in heat exchanger to ensure maximun possible heat transfer between two liquids.
* Validated the algorithm and the results by comparing the results with simulations from ANSYS.
* Additionally, I worked on designing a s-CO2 compressor by investigating effects of various design parameters and operating conditions in a sub-scale s-CO2 system at IISc.

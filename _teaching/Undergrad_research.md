Research Intern with Prof.[Amit Kumar Gupta](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/akgupta/profile) of the Mechanical Engineering Department, BITS-Pilani Hyderabad. 

Research Overview
======
Prof.[Amit Kumar Gupta](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/akgupta/profile)'s research focusses on Tensile testing, constitutive modeling, Sheet metal forming. The project we worked on compares and fits different constitutive models to stress-strain data different grade tungsten alloys. Additionally, we explored usage of different neural network to predict the elasticity of the alloys.


My Contributions
======
* Modified and modelled different constitutive equations - JC, ZA, Arrhenius, KHL and RK to different heavy alloys of tungsten and EDD steel at elevated temperatures and wide range of strain rates.
* Created a software that takes in input of stress, strain data, type of model to predict flow behaviour.
* Compared the predictions of these constitutive models with the experimental values using statistical measures like correlation coefficient, average absolute error and its standard deviation.
* Developed processing maps for better understanding of response of a material to the imposed experimental parameters.
* Implemented a partially-trained neural network in a central way in an iterative non-linear finite element analysis of the test specimen in order to extract approximate, but gradually improving, stressâ€“strain information with which to train the neural network.
